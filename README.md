## Python-Projects
Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small to large Python projects that I am working on as I continue to develop my programming skills. These projects range from simple scripts and games to more complex applications.


## Projects Included:

1. **Number Guessing Game**
   - A simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50.

2. **Acronym Generator**
   - This Python script generates an acronym from a user-provided phrase by taking the first letter of each word and converting it to uppercase. The user can create multiple acronyms in one session.

4. **Password Authentication System**
   - This Python script provides a basic secure login system with username validation, password attempts limit, and feedback on login success or failure.
  
5. **Age Calculator**
   - A Python script that calculates your approximate age based on the birthdate you enter, allowing you to try again if needed.
  
6. **Execution Time Calculator**
   - A Python script that calculates and displays the execution time for generating an acronym from the phrase "Data Base Management System".

7. **Automatic Email Sender**
   - A Python script that allows users to send automated emails using Gmail's SMTP server after entering their name and email address.

8. **Find Missing Number**
   - This Python script allows users to input a sequence of numbers, identifies the missing numbers in the sequence, and displays a combined list of the original and missing numbers, providing an option to repeat the process.

9. **Finance Tracker**
    - A Python application to manage personal finances, allowing users to record transactions, view summaries, and visualize income versus expenses over time.

10. **Least Common Multiple Calculator**
    - Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers entered by the user.

11. **Cafe Ordering System**
    - This Python script enables customers to place orders at Cafe Mangalore. It provides an interactive menu selection, computes order totals, applies discounts, and offers the option to generate PDF receipts. The order history is saved in a CSV file for future reference.

12. **Amazon Data Scraper**
    - A web scraper that extracts titles, prices, ratings, review counts, and availability of gaming laptops from Amazon India and saves the data to a CSV file.
   

13. **Simple Calculator**
    - This is a simple calculator application built using Python's `tkinter` library for creating graphical user interfaces. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits, operations, and a clear button.
