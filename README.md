## Python-Projects
Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small to large Python projects that I am working on as I continue to develop my programming skills. These projects range from simple scripts and games to more complex applications.


## Projects Included:

1. **Number Guessing Game**
   - A simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50.

2. **Acronym Generator**
   - This Python script generates an acronym from a user-provided phrase by taking the first letter of each word and converting it to uppercase. The user can create multiple acronyms in one session.

3. **Number Swapper**
   - This Python script swaps two user-provided numbers and displays the results before and after swapping.

4. **Password Authentication System**
   - This Python script provides a basic secure login system with username validation, password attempts limit, and feedback on login success or failure.
  
5. **Age Calculator**
   - A Python script that calculates your approximate age based on the birthdate you enter, allowing you to try again if needed.
  
6. **Execution Time Calculator**
   - A Python script that calculates and displays the execution time for generating an acronym from the phrase "Data Base Management System".

7. **Automatic Email Sender**
   - A Python script that allows users to send automated emails using Gmail's SMTP server after entering their name and email address.
