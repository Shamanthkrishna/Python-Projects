# Python-Projects
Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small to large Python projects that I am working on as I continue to develop my programming skills. These projects range from simple scripts and games to more complex applications.


# Projects Included:
1. **Number Guessing Game**:
  * A simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50.

2. **Acronym Generator**:
  * This Python script generates an acronym from a user-provided phrase by taking the first letter of each word and converting it to uppercase. The user can create multiple acronyms in one session.

3. **Number Swapper**:
   * This Python script swaps two user-provided numbers and displays the results before and after swapping.

4. **Password Authentication System**:
   * This Python script provides a basic secure login system with username validation, password attempts limit, and feedback on login success or failure.
